# Project Description
- This app provides valuable information for users on the developmental milestones of babies in the first year after birth **(0-12) months**. We want to make it easier for the users by providing data based on statistics/research on where their baby should be. The app also has other features like nutrition which notifies users when to feed their babies or the last time their baby was fed, and also investing strategies for the users to better prepare for their baby’s future.

**Idea 1: Baby Tracker**
*Summary:* 
This app provides valuable information for users on the developmental milestones of babies in the first year after birth (0-12) months. We want to make it easier for the users by providing data based on statistics/research on where their baby should be. The app also has other features like nutrition which notifies users when to feed their babies or the last time their baby was fed, and also investing strategies for the users to better prepare for their baby’s future.

*Pain Point App Addresses:* 
This application is being created to assist new parents with tracking the development of their new child.  Baby Tracker provides an easily accessible resource for newborn development information including nutrition, and investing.  Stretch goals would implement an IOT button that when pressed would trigger a lambda function that order diapers.

*Minimum MVP Definition:*
Users will be able to securely log in and save/track data pertinent to their child’s development and to see if their child is on track with most children their age. 
AWS Implementations:
- IAM
- Cognito
- Notifications
- DynamoDB
- Amazon Neptune (if new AWS system required)
- Stretch Goal: S3
- Stretch Goal: Lambda (w/IOT button)

**Idea 2: TAQ**
*Summary:* 
This app will enable Code Fellows students to enter their names in the queue when they need help from a TA with their labs. The TAQ app will be used by both TAs and students to confirm who is next in line for assistance.

*Pain Point App Addresses:*
Addresses multiple students waiting for teaching aide availability without knowledge of other students who are waiting ahead of them.

*Minimum MVP Definition:*
A queue with a student sign-up.  App will alert the first student waiting for assistance when the first TA becomes available.
